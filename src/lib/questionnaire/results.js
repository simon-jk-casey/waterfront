export const resultA = '>390, Great!  Your stream is very healthy and hence has a low priority for waterway management.  It provides important fish and wildlife habitat, and clean water for downstream users.  To maintain this quality, try to prevent any alterations or inputs, and continue to monitor your stream for any changes - use this form once a year, or more regularly if you think it necessary.  If you are interested we highly recommend reading Managing Riparian Zones: A Contribution to Protecting New Zealand\'s Rivers and Streams, Volumes 1 & 2 (1995) published by the Department of Conservation (DoC) and the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Reaseach (NIWA).'

export const resultB = '200-390.  Your stream has lots of potential and is at an intermediate priority level.  It provides habitat for some fish and those stream insects which are more tolerant to pollution.  If you want to improve the quality of your waterways and are unsure of where to begin,  Federated Farmers, Forest & Bird, Fish & Game, QEII National Trust or DoC will be able to help (see list of contacts).  Alternatively, the soil conservators and freshwater biologists at your local Regoinal Council will be able to offer advice or maybe grant assistance.  Landcare and AgResearch offer consultancy services in this area.'

export const resultC = '0-200.  Your stream is adversely effected by management practises in your area and therefore has a high priority for management.  Only pollution tolerant types of stream insects will be found in your stream.  To improve the quality of your stream, Federated Farmers, Forest & Bird, Fish & Game, QEII National Trust or DoC will be able to help (see list of contacts).  Alternatively, the soil conservators and freshwater biologists at your local Regoinal Council will be able to offer advice or maybe grant assistance.  Landcare and AgResearch offer consultancy services in this area.  It may be necessary to coordinate with your "upstream neighbours", as their management practises also affect the health of the stream as it flows through your property'
