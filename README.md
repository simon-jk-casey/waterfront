## TO DO
*stylesheets in own file - style containers, test style will break on navigate

*some components are containers, some of the code in these can be reduced into components used in container

* vulnerabilities: tried fixing, shit broke - do later (on own branch) good thing to know ... npm audit | grep Moderate/High -B3 -A10
